# Overview

The code defines a module named stackmat that interacts with audio input devices to capture, process, and analyze audio signals. The application captures the audio signal from the timer, processes the signal to decode the timer state, and updates the application's state accordingly. The module handles various tasks such as initializing the audio context, selecting input devices, processing audio signals, and analyzing the bits from the audio stream. 

# Summary

* Initialization: Sets up the audio context and requests access to the audio input device.

* Audio Processing: Captures and processes audio signals, normalizing the input and analyzing bits.

* State Management: Decodes the processed signal into timer states and manages the state transitions.

* Callbacks: Allows setting custom callback functions to handle the state updates.

This code combines Web Audio API features with custom signal processing logic to interact with specialized hardware, demonstrating how to handle audio input, process real-time data, and manage device-specific interactions in a web application.

# Key Components and Functions

1. **Global Variables and Initial Setup:**

 * `audio_context`, `audio_stream`, `source`, `node`: Variables related to the Web Audio API for managing audio input.

* `sample_rate`, `bitAnalyzer`, `curTimer`: Variables for managing the audio sample rate, bit analysis function, and current timer state.

2. **`updateInputDevices` Function:**

* This function retrieves a list of available audio input devices (microphones) using the navigator.`mediaDevices.enumerateDevices` API. It returns a promise that resolves to an array of devices.

3. **`init` Function:**

* Initializes the audio context and sets up audio input from the specified device.

* Checks if `getUserMedia` is supported by the browser and provides a polyfill for older browsers.

* Configures the audio context and sample rate based on the current timer.

* Requests access to the audio input device and connects the audio stream to a processing node.

4. **`stop` Function:**

* Stops the audio stream and disconnects the audio nodes.

5. **`success` Function:**

* Called when the audio stream is successfully obtained.

* Sets up an audio processing node to handle the audio data in chunks.

6. **Audio Processing and Signal Analysis:**

* The `procSignal` function processes the audio signal, normalizes it, and detects edges in the signal.

* The `appendBit` and `appendBitMoyu` functions analyze the bits from the processed audio signal and buffer them.

* The `decode` function decodes the buffered bits into meaningful data.

* The `pushNewState` function updates the state based on the decoded data and triggers a callback.

7. **State Management:**

* Manages the state of the stackmat timer, including properties such as time, unit, signal status, noise level, and power.

8. **Callback Handling:**

* Allows setting a callback function to handle the processed state data.

9. **Fallback for Native Stackmat:**

* If a native stackmat object is available, it provides an interface to use it directly, bypassing the Web Audio API setup.
